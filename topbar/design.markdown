While the majority of my work is on documentation with Dortania and Acidanthera, I do also work on design projects including website assets and app icons.

## ProperTree

* [Repo](https://github.com/CorpNewt/ProperTree)

A multiplatform plist editor written in python, I designed the icon with the idea of how plist files have ever-expanding branches of new entries and dictionaries. I additionally refreshed the icon's design with Big Sur's release.

## MaciASL

* [Repo](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL)

A simple yet useful ACPI editor for macOS, the original icon dated back to 2013. I wanted to update the design to be more Big Sur fitting, but keeping the original charm of the old icon.

## Dortania Assets

As I am the main author and maintainer of [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/), I also work a lot with the site's design and icons. Here are just a few of the icons I've designed for the organization:
