My name is Mykola Grymalyuk, or more commonly known as khronokernel. I do a lot work around macOS and hackintoshes, including co-founding [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/). This blog is less focussed on Hackintosh and Acidanthera news, for that I recommend checking out my other site [dortania.github.io](https://dortania.github.io)
