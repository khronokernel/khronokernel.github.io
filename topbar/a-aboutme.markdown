My name is Mykola Grymalyuk, or more commonly known as khronokernel. I do a lot of work around macOS and hackintoshes, including co-founding [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/). This blog is less focussed on Hackintosh and Acidanthera news, for that I recommend checking out my other site [dortania.github.io](https://dortania.github.io)

### How did you get started with hackintoshes?

To not bore you too much, I'll try to give a semi-simple timeline. More in-depth history can be found just by going through my Github and Reddit history ;p

When I was 13, my mother was dating a guy at the time who was an Apple enthusiast and collector. He did laptop repairs before and had gifted me a 2011 13" MacBookAir(MacBookAir4,2) running Mavericks. That was my first experience with OS X.

A few months later, I found an old Acer Aspire(Core2 Quad Q6600) sitting by the side of a dumpster with a monitor. We took it in and the machine still worked! My mom's boyfriend already had his own hackintosh in a PowerMac G5 case, so I decided I wanted to try that out as well on my new PC. I first started out with [tonymacx86's iBoot](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/iboot-3-3-0.38/) and running Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and was an unsurprising headache to setup with how sparse good documentation was.

From there, hackintoshing was mostly a casual hobby for a few years. In late 2018 however, I became much more active in the community. My first big contribution was the [Mojave GPU buyers Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/b91vf5/mojave_gpu_buyers_guide/) where I documented the numerous GPUs supported in Mojave at the time. This spiraled out more into the old [khronokernel.gitbook.io](https://khronokernel-1.gitbook.io/getting-started-with-opencore/) sites and eventually the Dortania organization we know today!

### Where did the name Dortania and Khronokernel come from?


* **Dortania:** DhinakG(the other co-founder) and I wanted a name that was unique, easy to find as well as have some relation to the Acidanthera flower.

* **Khronokernel:** This one is a bit more complicated, as the name revolves around my chronic illness. I have Crohn's disease and back in 2019, I had the idea to make an app that would help track your stool output, Chrono Colon! The app never released officially, however, the name stuck with me so much that I wanted to re-incorporate it into my "professional" account. So I merged my love for messing with Apple's XNU kernel with the time theme from Chrono Colon to make Khronokernel!Thanks so much for the reply in advance,
