### Dortania Documentation

An organization dedicated to documenting the many aspects of macOS booting on PC hardware, we have consolidated much of the complicated nature of hackintoshing into multiple cohesive guides that many non-technical users can easily follow.

* [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)
  * Guide dedicated to the process of setting up, booting and installing a Hackintosh.
  * Includes documentation on laptops, desktops, and machines in between.
* [OpenCore Post-Install](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/)
  * Guide dedicated to the clean up and miscellaneous fixes of hackintoshes once installed.

Other guides are listed here:

* [Dortania's Getting Started](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started/)

### [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher)

This tool is designed to help Mac users easily build OpenCore-based configurations suited for their legacy Mac. By using OpenCore' sophisticated kext injection system, we're able to patch older, unsupported Macs into running newer OSes with zero filesystem modifications. This allows many of macOS's security features to be enabled including APFS-snapshotting, SIP and FileVault as well as native OS updates!

Currently no other patcher currently supports such a rich featureset.

### Miscellaneous Design Work

While the majority of my work is on documentation with Dortania and Acidanthera, I do also work on design projects including website assets and app icons.

* [ProperTree](#propertree)
* [MaciASL](#maciasl)
* [Dortania Assets](#dortania-assets)

#### ProperTree

* [Repo](https://github.com/CorpNewt/ProperTree)

A multiplatform plist editor written in python, I designed the icon with the idea of how plist files have ever-expanding branches of new entries and dictionaries. I additionally refreshed the icon's design with Big Sur's release.

#### MaciASL

* [Repo](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL)

A simple yet useful ACPI editor for macOS, the original icon dated back to 2013. I wanted to update the design to be more Big Sur fitting, but keeping the original charm of the old icon.

#### Dortania Assets

As I am the main author and maintainer of [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/), I also work a lot with the site's design and icons. Here are just a few of the icons I've designed for the organization:
