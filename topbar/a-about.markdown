Hello, welcome to my site! My name is Mykola but I go by many names, Hackintosh Slav, boomer, u/dracoflar, immigrant, Khronokernel but my friends just call me slav. This site is mainly used to keep my thoughts and my guides in so people can easily find them without much hassle

Regarding myself, I've been doing hacks since 2013. With my step dad introducing me to the world of both Macintoshes and Hackintoshes, starting with Chameleon then later Clover and now we are here: The dawn of OpenCore! I'm also a moderator on the r/hackintosh subreddit where post once a month, but my time is mostly spent now writing and maintaining my Hackintosh guides

Need to get in touch with me? Couple ways:

* Email: khronokernel@icloud.com
   * Please don't ask me to make you a hackintosh
* Discord: Hackintosh Slav on the [r/hackintosh Discord](https://discord.gg/Wxam8aH)
   * Again, please don't ask me to make you a hackintosh. I will bean you
