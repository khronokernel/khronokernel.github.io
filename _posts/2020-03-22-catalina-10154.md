So today marks the release of macOS 10.15.4, a pretty average release for most users but quite a special one for laptop, Clover and AMD CPU users. 

For details on what's changed OS wise:

* [Apple Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_4_release_notes)
   * Pretty useless tbh
* [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/24/apple-releases-macos-catalina-10-15-4/)
   * Much more info

# Laptops

With this release, we now have official Ice Lake support! Do note that Apple rarely supports GT1 GPUs for more than a .1 update as more of an accident so be wary. At the moment we know the following iGPUs are supported:

* Iris Plus G4
* Iris Plus G7

Other issues are:

* We still need framebuffer dumps to know the best platform ID
* MacBookAir9,1 isn't yet supported by [MacInfoPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/MacInfoPkg)
* Memory protections are in place breaking AptioMemoryFix, OpenCore, and OcQuirks

OpenCore fixed the last one in 0.5.7 thanks to the quirk `ProtectUefiServices` which fixes the use of DevirtulizeMMIO allowing the macOS kernel to fit nicely. `ProtectUefiServices` has been added to [OcQuirks](https://github.com/ReddestDream/OcQuirks/releases) from revision 19. So be patient and don't rush out to buy a machine *just* for hackintoshing

**Note**: This is only for Icelake laptops, this issue is not related to macOS instead the firmware found on these machines

# Clover

Oh what fun, Clover's drunk again and won't boot for some of you! The specific issue seems to be only for Skylake and newer users. The specific of what happened:

* Apple added Ice Lake and Comet Lake support to the kernel
* Problem is it wouldn't fit as-is, so the mask of the processor changed
* This then meant that it turned from 16 bits to 20 bits long
* This then broke Clover's `KernelPM` and `AppleIntelCPUPM` patch

So because of this change, we have 4 paths to go down:

* Disable CFG-Lock in the BIOS 
   * See [Disabling CFG-Lock Guide](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/extras/msr-lock)
* Use a CPU ID that still works with the old KernelPM patch
   * Broadwell and older are fine
   * Note doing this can partially or completely break XCPM

* Update to Clover with commit version [af8a84f](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/commit/af8a84f4784f657e8d8937f0a19dc9695e22f6d9) or later
   * [r5107](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases) is the minimum version, plus recent Cover updates moved to C++ breaking a lot of things so keep a backup
* Buy a hackintosh that starts with the letter M 

For the CPU ID route, you can spoof to a Broadwell-H CPU with the following:

```text
config.plist -> KernelAndKextPatches -> FakeCPUID -> 0x040674
```

*  Remember doing this can partially or even completely break XCPM

And ofc, OpenCore doesn't have any issues with this update. Just another nudge to go to the dark side. The specifics behind this is that Clover doesn't know anything about symbols or structures, and so the patch is very generic whereas OpenCore can be much more precise.

# AMD Users

So with this update, the `CPU Family` patch has broken due to Ice Lake and Comet Lake shoving themselves in and changing the placing of families. So users will need to update their Kernel patches, specifically the following:
