With macOS monterey, Apple added a ton of new features to the OS including a new Safari, Shortcuts, etc. Today I wanted to take a peak at one of theses features: AirPlay to Mac

The idea is simple, allow your Mac running Monterey to become an AirPlay 2 complaint receiver supporting both audio and video streams. However internally it was decided to limit support to a select few Intel models instead of allowing the feature across the line.

Officially supported models by Apple:

```
MacBookAir8,x  (2018 Intel T2 MacBook Air)
MacBookPro15,x (2018 Intel T2 MacBook Pro)
iMac19,x       (2019 Intel iMac)
Macmini9,1     (2020 AS M1 Mac mini)
MacPro7,1      (2019 Intel Mac Pro)
```

### Why did Apple only support these models?

At first glance, this limitation seems to be based off the T2 however upon closer inspection we see this is incorrect. Specifically iMac19,1 has no T2 and ships with a basic Polaris 20 dGPU core.

> So is AirPlay to Mac reliant on H.265? If so, why did Skylake Macs get dropped?

Well when we look at AirPlay to Mac, we see it actually has no H.265 requirement. This is because AirPlay To Mac, unlike Sidecar, is almost entirely video decode based instead of encode. Why this is important is that Apple's graphics stack already supports proper hardware accelerated decode on H.264 based GPUs

For Sidecar however, the only GPUs to properly support encode support are Intel's Skylake+ iGPUs as well as Apple's T2 chip. Older Intel iGPUs will fall back on software encoding by default however AMD and Nvidia dGPUs do not automatically.

### So where does Apple hard code support?

So with macOS Big Sur and newer, Apple moved to a massive dyld cache approach for storing all the binaries. This means that on disk there are no longer any proper binaries to grep the system for, instead one massive file that will take a week to load into a decompiler. Thanks to a great observation by [@zhuowei](https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/1402137181502722051), we're able to extract all the binaries that reside in this cache.

After compiling and running his file, I was able to rip all the binaries from Monterey's dyld cache.

After this, it was trivially easy to find out where Apple hard coded the SMBIOS. After about 5 min, I found that AirPlaySupport.framework holds the array of blacklisted models (oddly enough, Apple made 2 arrays. Taking a closer look, array 1 is a copy paste of SidecarCore's blacklist [Ben-z discovered in Catalina](https://github.com/ben-z/free-sidecar)):

```
# First Array (Identical that that found in SidecarCore)
iMac13,1iMac13,2iMac13,3iMac14,1iMac14,2iMac14,3iMac14,4iMac15,1iMac16,1iMac16,2MacBook8,1MacBookAir5,1MacBookAir5,2MacBookAir6,1MacBookAir6,2MacBookAir7,1MacBookAir7,2MacBookPro9,1MacBookPro9,2MacBookPro10,1MacBookPro10,2MacBookPro11,1MacBookPro11,2MacBookPro11,3MacBookPro11,4MacBookPro11,5MacBookPro12,1Macmini6,1Macmini6,2Macmini7,1MacPro5,1MacPro6,1
```

```
# Second Array
iMac17,1iMac18,1iMac18,2iMac18,3MacBookPro13,1MacBookPro13,2MacBookPro13,3MacBookPro14,1MacBookPro14,2MacBookPro14,3MacMini8,1
```
Something you may have noticed is that MacBook9,1 and MacBook10,1 are not included. It seems with Developer Beta 1, the engineers completely forgot that they even made a 12" Skylake/Kabylake Machines. I fully expect before release for someone to notice and correct.

### Working around this software lock

I've written some patch sets to allow for support of both AirPlay to Mac as well as Sidecar on supported SMBIOS into [SidecarFixup](https://github.com/acidanthera/SidecarFixup) and below is the documented patches (Sidecar patches originate from [Ben-z](https://github.com/ben-z/free-sidecar)):

AirPlay to Mac works on virtually every Mac without issue however Sidecar does require an H.265 iGPU to function.

* Its been discovered that you can force systems with AMD GPUs into software encode by forcing an iMac19,x or iMac20,x SMBIOS and running the following command:

```sh
defaults write com.apple.AppleGVA gvaForceAMDKE -boolean yes
```

Nvidia dGPU only machines seem to be out of luck unfortunately.


### Closing thoughts

Overall for a first developer beta, I am quite impressed with the stability of AirPlay to Mac. However from a technical point of view, I am disappointed in how management decided to cripple older, very capable Macs for no real purpose. Unlike Sidecar, AirPlay already works fantastic and honestly could save some old Macs from the trash heap and instead become AirPlay displays for newer Macs in the future. Even if Target Display Mode is dead on most Macs, AirPlay to Mac gives them some simple, easy way to live on.
